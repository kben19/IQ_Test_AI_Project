# IQ_Test_AI_Project
by Kelvin Benzali

# Description
This project is about developing a program of artificial intelligence that takes input of IQ test and solve the problems. The purposes of this project is to make a program that pass the minimum score of IQ test. In other words, the IQ tests can be solved by an artificial intelligence which can raise a question of the efficiency of the IQ test itself and the development progress in artificial intelligence field.

# Functionalities
-	The program understand the meaning of the questions
-	The program able to receive single input of IQ test from the user
-	The program able to take a file containing a modified format of IQ tests consist of multiple
-	The program shows the statistic of the answered questions for file input type
-	The program is able to solve Insert missing number IQ type questions
-	The program is able to solve Pick the odd one out IQ type questions
-	The program is able to solve IQ questions involving directions

# Requirements
